The arbitrator's award shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction.

Further, unless both you and GlideSwipe agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
